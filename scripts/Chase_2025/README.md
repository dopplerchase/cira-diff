# Nowcasting IR data

## introduction 

This folder contains the exact python scripts to train the models in the paper titled "Score based diffusion nowcasting of GOES imagery". Note some paths are likely different because I renamed the scripts and datasets, but this is the bulk of the code. 

Example call:

`` accelerate launch train_edm_Chase2025.py ``
